# Note-Taker

## Description
This project is a website with a browser-server (front-end back-end) relationship that gives the user the ability to write, store and delete notes. Each note is given a unique ID. This is done with 'crypto' which renders the hash in hexidecimal. Although this ID method is a bit over the top, it seems like a better way to securely store data in future projects with an encryption feature. When a note is selected or deleted; it references this ID. (ie. notes/3a18af6f59350b)
